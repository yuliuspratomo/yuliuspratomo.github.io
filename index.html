  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Yulius Pratomo is an economist and academic whose primary research focus lies in international macroeconomics, particularly in international trade, foreign direct investment, exchange rate dynamics, foreign reserves, and the inflation–growth relationship in an open economy. His work examines how the Indonesian economy responds to regional integration, global crises, and external shocks such as the Asian Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.
His research has been published in various national and international journals, addressing issues of trade performance, comparative advantage, and macroeconomic stability. By combining macroeconomic perspectives with quantitative methods, his work contributes to evidence-based economic policy and a deeper understanding of how global forces shape domestic economic outcomes.
